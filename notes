* separate backend and frontend

todo:
* visible algorithm


* map generator: better pathfinding
	* for each room, select edge point -> edge point loc list
	* for each edge point, a connection to random edge point
		* connection by an algorithm. when path digging hits '.', set '.' as isConnected
		* after each edgepoint, reiterate room list and remove isConnected


* refactor: methods with Capitals, struct parameters with mixedCase

* floor as struct with rooms attached

* currently: '<' as downstairs, 'E' on floor 0; change?

* tidying up: 
    * placePlayer() / switchFloors() as methods of gameMap?
    * floorgen as struct with floor & floorname
