* separate backend and frontend

todo:
* floor switcher

* map generator: better pathfinding
	* for each room, select edge point -> edge point loc list
	* for each edge point, a connection to random edge point
		* connection by an algorithm. when path digging hits '.', set '.' as isConnected
		* after each edgepoint, reiterate room list and remove isConnected


* refactor: methods with Capitals, struct parameters with mixedCase

* floor as struct with rooms attached
